  shortDescription: Generate shell completion scripts for different kubectl plugins
  version: v0.1.0
  description: |
    Enable shell completion for some installed plugins (supports over 50% of krew plugins).
  caveats: |
    kubectl v1.24 is required for shell completion to work for plugins.

    This plugin will only activate shell completion for plugins that use the
    popular Cobra Go library (https://github.com/spf13/cobra).

    Although just as effective, this plugin is a temporary solution until your
    favorite plugins provide shell completion themselves.
